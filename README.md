# Github Exercise
 The GitHub API is documented here: https://docs.github.com/en/rest

 We will be connecting to this API to create a version of 'github'.
 //You should clone this repo and in terminal type sbt run, in your browser on localhost:9000 you should see a page with the title "Welcome to your version of GitHub".
 
  //For package structure use standard: view (html templates), controller (API endpoint entry), service (Orchestration, should be light weight seeing as    we're only calling one endpoint), connector (To speak to api.github), model (Domain model data representation).
 Using the GitHub API it’s a lot easier if upfront you start to use your own git credentials for authorisation (to avoid rate limits) -    https://developer.github.com/v3/auth/#basic-authentication (no need to worry about authorisation at the moment you can come back to this once you get to task 9 as authorisation is needed when you start creating and deleting in repositories on the github api)

 //When writing your code only have working code on your main branch and for each new feature create a branch to create this. When this new feature is done and all the code is working create a pull request to merge your branch into main.
 
## Task 1.
 Your mongodb should contain users which will have the following information: username, date account created, location, number of followers, number following.
    Look at the return of a user from the GitHub API to help you make your model of a user. //Try inputting your GitHub username into the url to see: https://api.github.com/users/{yourUsername}
 
 Set up your mongodb database and a model of the user it will accept.
 When adding users to the database make sure there cannot be duplicate usernames inside the database.
 
 ## Task 2.
 Create a route that will return a user from the GitHub API with the route:
 {url}/github/users/{username}

 When somebody accesses your app at the above url, you should display the user on a views page.
 Use this connector to do this:
 https://api.github.com/users/{username}

## Task 3.
 Make routes for all the CRUD commands (Create Read Update Delete)
 
 ## Task 4.
  //Make a route to add a user from the GitHub API to your repository.
 
 ## Task 5.
  Make a  new route: /github/users/{userName}/repositories That will list the names of all public repositories for the provided username
  Make use of the GitHub API: https://api.github.com/users/{username}/repos
  Once this page exists, add a link “Repositories” to the page created in Task 1, so that as a website user you can navigate from somebodies profile to their list of repositories
 
## Task 6.
 Add a new route /github/users/:username/repos/:repoName
 On this page display the names of files & folders (as determined by an API call) for the selected usernames’ repository.
 
 ## Task 7.
  //Stretch exercise.
  
  //Make a new route GET /github/users/:username/repos/:repoName/*path
  The path will be path to file I.E app/controllers/HelloWorldController.scala, you can base64 encode path for ease
  If the path given resolves to a file, display the plaintext of the file on the page.
  If the path given is a folder, display the files & folder names (In the same way it's displayed in the first part of Task 4)
  
## Task 8. 
 //(Assuming task 7 stretch is complete)
 Link up the pages. I.E the first step of task 5 doesn't only list the files/folders, but they are hyperlinks that will direct to the correct page in the  stretch exercise.
 For example, /github/users/jxr227/repos/ROScratch, will show various files and folders including the folder "exercises". If you click "exercises" you  will be directed to:
 /github/users/jxr227/repos/ROScratch/exercises
 
 Do the same on the /*path pages, so that you can, from the top level of a repository, browse all folders and files.

## Task 9.
 //if you haven't already done so write integration and unit tests for all your methods. When it comes to unit testing your connector (the file using ws client that connects to the API) you can use wiremock to mock the API responses. 
 
 To use wiremock in your library dependencies in the build.sbt file add:
    "com.github.tomakehurst" % "wiremock-jre8" % "2.33.2" % Test

 //When you run test if you get an error about jackson databind after adding the wiremock try adding this to your build.sbt file:
 dependencyOverrides +="com.fasterxml.jackson.core" % "jackson-databind" % "2.11.0"

## Task 10.
 //Now try and get, create, update and delete files in a repository on the GitHub API.
 Follow this link for instructions and work your way through each of the steps:
 https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/contents?apiVersion=2022-11-28
 You will need a personal access token to make changes in the API. This token should NOT be hardcoded into your code, as it should be for your eyes only. Try storing it as a permanent environment variable called AuthPassword, e.g. export AuthPassword= yourToken.
 For details on how to create an access token see: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token
 Made curl requests in terminal for these routes and write tests to check they are all working.

## Task 11.
 Now that you have accomplished step 10 instead of using curl requests in terminal try creating a form, so you can complete these routes from your browser.

## Task 12.
 //Add some css styling to the layout of your pages.
